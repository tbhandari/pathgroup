                     <p>Tyler Finklea, Ph.D. received her doctorate in Combined Counseling and School Psychology from Florida State University. While there she conducted research on the intersection of mental health and career difficulties. She completed an APA Accredited internship at American University in Washington, D.C., followed by an APA Accredited postdoctoral fellowship with Emory Universityâs Counseling and Psychological Services. She has worked at four university counseling centers, including as a staff psychologist at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
                     <p>She believes in the potential for growth and strives to walk alongside her clients to help them heal the past and live more fully in the present. Therapy may explore how oneâs past is influencing the present, may focus on a concern in the present that needs immediate attention, or could be a combination of the two. She collaborates with her clients to identify these needs and goals throughout the process of therapy.</p>
                     <p>She approaches therapy through an integrative lens, including psychodynamic, relational, and mindfulness teachings and practices to work with clients to address a wide range of concerns. She especially finds working with adolescents and adults on identity development at all stages of life including LGBTQ+ identity development, anxiety, trauma, family of origin concerns, and life transitions to be fulfilling.</p>
