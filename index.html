                     <p>Tyler Finklea, Ph.D. received her doctorate in Combined Counseling and School Psychology from Florida State University. While there she conducted research on the intersection of mental health and career difficulties. She completed an APA Accredited internship at American University in Washington, D.C., followed by an APA Accredited postdoctoral fellowship with Emory University’s Counseling and Psychological Services. She has worked at four university counseling centers, including as a staff psychologist at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
                     <p>She believes in the potential for growth and strives to walk alongside her clients to help them heal the past and live more fully in the present. Therapy may explore how one’s past is influencing the present, may focus on a concern in the present that needs immediate attention, or could be a combination of the two. She collaborates with her clients to identify these needs and goals throughout the process of therapy.</p>
                     <p>She approaches therapy through an integrative lens, including psychodynamic, relational, and mindfulness teachings and practices to work with clients to address a wide range of concerns. She especially finds working with adolescents and adults on identity development at all stages of life including LGBTQ+ identity development, anxiety, trauma, family of origin concerns, and life transitions to be fulfilling.</p>

                     <p>Trevor Strickland, MS received his degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from Georgia State University. He completed his practicum and internship at the Decatur High School Student Center, where he primarily worked with adolescents and their families in groups and individual sessions on a variety of issues, including but not limited to: anxiety, depression, stress, trauma, adjustment disorders, developmental delays, mood and personality disorders, social isolation, addiction, crisis and suicide intervention, gender identity and sexuality, and other mental health diagnoses with varying severity. He is certified and recognized as a Nationally Certified Counselor (NCC) by the National Board for Certified Counselors. As an Associate Professional Counselor (APC), he works under the supervision of Dr. Elana Zimand while working towards licensure as an LPC. He is trained and certified in ASSIST and Suicide-2-Hope (suicide interventions).</p>
                     <p>He believes that everyone suffers in some way or another, and our lives are in a constant state of flux. Everything changes on its own at some point, but we can learn to steer change in a way that benefits us and those around us by better understanding how we respond to suffering. He utilizes mindfulness practices, CBT skills, and a variety of other interventions to help clients see their problems clearly and create tangible plans for overcoming them. Children who are faced with adversity or struggle within their contexts (i.e. family relationships, peer relationships, academic struggles) benefit from exposure to fundamental life experiences that directly improve their developmental and emotional growth.</p>
                     <p>Therapy focuses on shifting our perception of problems so that the problem becomes an opportunity for growth and connection. For that shift to happen, we must develop non-judgemental awareness of our habitual reactions to suffering. We also learn to let go of preconceived notions about who we are and how we think life should be. Learning to let go allows us to gain clear insights into our struggles and failures, and improves our ability to accept and move through our problems. He believes there are three ways of learning - faith, intellectual investigation, and direct experience. Practice and exposure to the direct experience of skills and concepts are emphasized, especially when working with children.  Once new skills are learned and practiced, we can begin to discover new ways of responding to old issues, moving into new possibilities that align with our deepest values.</p>

Voicemails and emails will be reviewed the next business day during regular office hours.</li><br>
                        <li><b>What if I/my child/loved one needs emergency assistance?</b>  Our clinicians <b><u>do not</u></b> provide any crisis care or emergent medical or psychiatric services.  Please contact 911 or visit the nearest hospital emergency department in case of an emergency. You can also contact the Georgia Crisis and Access line at <a href=\"tel:+18007154225\">1-800-715-4225</a>, which provides 24/7 access to mental health services.</li><br>
                        <li><b>How can I request a medication refill?</b>  Medication refill requests are submitted through our website by finding the "Patient Forms" tab on our menu at the top right and choosing the "Medication Refill Request form" option.  If you do not have access to the internet, alternatively, you can call the office at <a href=\"tel:+14042355982\">404.235.5982</a> and leave a message with the name of the medication, dose, quantity, and the pharmacy name along with the phone number.<br><b>Refill requests do not constitute an emergency during non-business hours. Please be mindful that you have enough medication during weekends and holidays.</b>  Please note that we do not respond to pharmacy requests for refills as they are often automated/inaccurate.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Can I email my clinician?</b>  Each clinician has their own email policy, which can be discussed at your appointment. Generally, it is requested that emails sent to your clinician are for brief questions only. Extensive emails will require an appointment.<br>Please note: Emails are not regularly checked after hours, weekends, and holidays.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Can I call my clinician?</b>  Each clinician has their own telephone policy, which can be discussed at your appointment. Phone calls are reserved for urgent questions during non-business hours.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Where is the office located?</b>  We are located at 550 Pharr Rd NE, in suite 605.<br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3969.592667615135!2d-84.37274778334142!3d33.838068206899386!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88f505f2272cc503%3A0x29e0d7f2770df2c5!2sPath%20Group%20of%20Atlanta%20LLC!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1752188825611!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe></li><br>
                        <li><b>Where can I park for my appointment?</b>  There is an underground garage with elevator access that is free of charge. After parking, take the elevator to the 6th floor for suite 605 - which is directly to the right of the elevators when exiting them.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Do you accept insurance?</b>  Our practice does not accept any forms of health insurance. Our scheduling platform will auto-generate and email you a monthly superbill (which will include all appointments within that month) if you would like to file for possible reimbursement with your insurance's out-of-network benefits.</li><br>
                        <li><b>What are your fees?</b>  Our appointment fees vary depending on the age of the patient and whether they are requesting psychiatry or therapy services. Please contact the office directly for our updated fees.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Do you see patients outside of Georgia?</b>  Our physicians can only provide care for patients in Georgia at the time of all appointments (including phone and telehealth). Medications will only be prescribed to a pharmacy in Georgia. We highly encourage new patients who will not be in Georgia for the whole year to find a clinician in the state where they reside/go to school.</li><br>
                        <li><b>How often do I need an appointment with my psychiatrist?</b>  Appointment frequency is based on several factors, including the type of medication a patient is currently on. Follow-up appointments are generally every three months, though this frequency may vary due to factors such as medication changes. Patients must be seen in person at the office at least once a year.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Do you do any screening/testing (i.e., for ADHD)?</b>  In terms of evaluations/testing, we do not conduct any formal testing during the new patient appointment. During the initial appointment, the doctor will ask questions about your psychiatric and medical history (similar to a PCP appointment). They may ask other questions about your background like your school, work, and relationship history. If appropriate, the diagnosis of ADHD may be made, as well as a recommendation to start medication. Sometimes the doctor may diagnose something else and/or recommend something else. Together, you may decide that other testing is needed (bloodwork, psychological testing), and the appropriate next steps will be discussed.</li><br>
                        <li><b>What is your cancellation policy?</b>  Your scheduled appointment is reserved for you and only you. We do not overbook.  Therefore, we have a strict 24-hour cancellation policy. If you are unable to keep your scheduled appointment, please call or email at least 24 hours in advance to cancel or reschedule your appointment. Please keep in mind that our schedule can fill up quickly.<br><br>If you do not cancel your appointment more than 24 hours in advance or if you fail to show for your appointment, you will be responsible for the full cost of the appointment.</li><br>
