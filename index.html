                     <p>Tyler Finklea, Ph.D. received her doctorate in Combined Counseling and School Psychology from Florida State University. While there she conducted research on the intersection of mental health and career difficulties. She completed an APA Accredited internship at American University in Washington, D.C., followed by an APA Accredited postdoctoral fellowship with Emory University’s Counseling and Psychological Services. She has worked at four university counseling centers, including as a staff psychologist at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
                     <p>She believes in the potential for growth and strives to walk alongside her clients to help them heal the past and live more fully in the present. Therapy may explore how one’s past is influencing the present, may focus on a concern in the present that needs immediate attention, or could be a combination of the two. She collaborates with her clients to identify these needs and goals throughout the process of therapy.</p>
                     <p>She approaches therapy through an integrative lens, including psychodynamic, relational, and mindfulness teachings and practices to work with clients to address a wide range of concerns. She especially finds working with adolescents and adults on identity development at all stages of life including LGBTQ+ identity development, anxiety, trauma, family of origin concerns, and life transitions to be fulfilling.</p>

My work is grounded in empathy, curiosity, and a deep respect for each client’s unique story.</p>
                     <p>I specialize in supporting teens and young adults navigating anxiety, relationship struggles, life transitions, trauma, and identity exploration.

                     <p>Trevor Strickland received his Master’s degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from Georgia State University. He is a <b>Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC)</b> in the state of Georgia and a <b>Nationally Certified Counselor (NCC)</b> through the National Board for Certified Counselors.</p>
                     <p>He completed his practicum and internship at the Decatur High School Student Center, where he primarily worked with adolescents and their families in both group and individual settings. During that time, he addressed a wide range of issues including anxiety, depression, stress, trauma, life transitions, developmental delays, mood and personality disorders, social isolation, addiction, crisis and suicide intervention, gender identity and sexuality, and other mental health challenges of varying severity.</p>
                     <p>Trevor has continued this work with teens, tweens, and young adults at Path Group of Atlanta, where he has also expanded his experience by working with adults to develop mindfulness skills, navigate interpersonal conflicts, and reconnect with meaning and purpose in life.</p>
                     <p>He believes that everyone experiences suffering in some form, and that life is in a constant state of change. While change often happens on its own, we can learn to guide it in a way that benefits ourselves and those around us by better understanding how we respond to, relate to, and carry our pain. Trevor utilizes mindfulness practices, CBT and ACT-based interventions, and other evidence-informed approaches to help clients gain clarity around their challenges and create tangible plans for growth.</p>
                     <p>In therapy, Trevor focuses on helping clients shift their perception of problems—viewing difficulties as opportunities for growth and connection. For this shift to occur, we cultivate nonjudgmental awareness of our habitual reactions to suffering and learn to release preconceived notions about who we are or how life “should” be. By learning to let go and create space, clients can gain deeper insight into their struggles, increase self-acceptance, and move through problems with greater flexibility.</p>
                     <p>Trevor believes that there are three primary ways of learning: through faith, intellectual exploration, and direct experience. He emphasizes practice and experiential learning—especially when working with children—so that clients can internalize new skills and apply them to real-life challenges. As these skills become integrated, clients discover new ways of responding to old problems, opening up possibilities that align with their deepest values.</p>

Voicemails and emails will be reviewed the next business day during regular office hours.</li><br>
                        <li><b>What if I/my child/loved one needs emergency assistance?</b>  Our clinicians <b><u>do not</u></b> provide any crisis care or emergent medical or psychiatric services.  Please contact 911 or visit the nearest hospital emergency department in case of an emergency. You can also contact the Georgia Crisis and Access line at <a href=\"tel:+18007154225\">1-800-715-4225</a>, which provides 24/7 access to mental health services.</li><br>
                        <li><b>How can I request a medication refill?</b>  Medication refill requests are submitted through our website by finding the "Patient Forms" tab on our menu at the top right and choosing the "Medication Refill Request form" option.  If you do not have access to the internet, alternatively, you can call the office at <a href=\"tel:+14042355982\">404.235.5982</a> and leave a message with the name of the medication, dose, quantity, and the pharmacy name along with the phone number.<br><b>Refill requests do not constitute an emergency during non-business hours. Please be mindful that you have enough medication during weekends and holidays.</b>  Please note that we do not respond to pharmacy requests for refills as they are often automated/inaccurate.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Can I email my clinician?</b>  Each clinician has their own email policy, which can be discussed at your appointment. Generally, it is requested that emails sent to your clinician are for brief questions only. Extensive emails will require an appointment.<br>Please note: Emails are not regularly checked after hours, weekends, and holidays.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Can I call my clinician?</b>  Each clinician has their own telephone policy, which can be discussed at your appointment. Phone calls are reserved for urgent questions during non-business hours.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Where is the office located?</b>  We are located at 550 Pharr Rd NE, in suite 605.<br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3969.592667615135!2d-84.37274778334142!3d33.838068206899386!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88f505f2272cc503%3A0x29e0d7f2770df2c5!2sPath%20Group%20of%20Atlanta%20LLC!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1752188825611!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe></li><br>
                        <li><b>Where can I park for my appointment?</b>  There is an underground garage with elevator access that is free of charge. After parking, take the elevator to the 6th floor for suite 605 - which is directly to the right of the elevators when exiting them.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Do you accept insurance?</b>  Our practice does not accept any forms of health insurance. Our scheduling platform will auto-generate and email you a monthly superbill (which will include all appointments within that month) if you would like to file for possible reimbursement with your insurance's out-of-network benefits.</li><br>
                        <li><b>What are your fees?</b>  Our appointment fees vary depending on the age of the patient and whether they are requesting psychiatry or therapy services. Please contact the office directly for our updated fees.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Do you see patients outside of Georgia?</b>  Our physicians can only provide care for patients in Georgia at the time of all appointments (including phone and telehealth). Medications will only be prescribed to a pharmacy in Georgia. We highly encourage new patients who will not be in Georgia for the whole year to find a clinician in the state where they reside/go to school.</li><br>
                        <li><b>How often do I need an appointment with my psychiatrist?</b>  Appointment frequency is based on several factors, including the type of medication a patient is currently on. Follow-up appointments are generally every three months, though this frequency may vary due to factors such as medication changes. Patients must be seen in person at the office at least once a year.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Do you do any screening/testing (i.e., for ADHD)?</b>  In terms of evaluations/testing, we do not conduct any formal testing during the new patient appointment. During the initial appointment, the doctor will ask questions about your psychiatric and medical history (similar to a PCP appointment). They may ask other questions about your background like your school, work, and relationship history. If appropriate, the diagnosis of ADHD may be made, as well as a recommendation to start medication. Sometimes the doctor may diagnose something else and/or recommend something else. Together, you may decide that other testing is needed (bloodwork, psychological testing), and the appropriate next steps will be discussed.</li><br>
                        <li><b>What is your cancellation policy?</b>  Your scheduled appointment is reserved for you and only you. We do not overbook.  Therefore, we have a strict 24-hour cancellation policy. If you are unable to keep your scheduled appointment, please call or email at least 24 hours in advance to cancel or reschedule your appointment. Please keep in mind that our schedule can fill up quickly.<br><br>If you do not cancel your appointment more than 24 hours in advance or if you fail to show for your appointment, you will be responsible for the full cost of the appointment.</li><br>
